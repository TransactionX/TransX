All core commands that are provided by default.

The core commands are split into multiple subcommands and `Run` is the default subcommand. From the CLI user
perspective, it is not visible that `Run` is a subcommand. So, all parameters of `Run` are exported as main executable
parameters.

    -h, --help                       
            Prints help information

        --legacy-network-protocol    
            Use the legacy "pre-mainnet-launch" networking protocol. Enable if things seem broken. This option will be
            removed in the future
        --light                      
            Experimental: Run in light client mode

        --no-grandpa                 
            Disable GRANDPA voter when running in validator mode, otherwise disable the GRANDPA observer

        --no-mdns                    
            Disable mDNS discovery.
            
            By default, the network will use mDNS to discover other nodes on the local network. This disables it.
            Automatically implied when using --dev.
        --no-private-ipv4            
            Forbid connecting to private IPv4 addresses (as specified in
            [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)), unless the address was passed with `--reserved-nodes` or
            `--bootnodes`
        --no-prometheus              
            Do not expose a Prometheus metric endpoint.

        --no-telemetry               
            Disable connecting to the Substrate telemetry server.
            
            Telemetry is on by default on global chains.
        --no-yamux-flow-control      
            Disable the yamux flow control. This option will be removed in the future once there is enough confidence
            that this feature is properly working
        --one                        
            Shortcut for `--name One --validator` with session keys for `One` added to keystore

        --password-interactive       
            Use interactive shell for entering the password used by the keystore

        --prometheus-external        
            Listen to all Prometheus data source interfaces.
            
            Default is local.
        --reserved-only              
            Whether to only allow connections to/from reserved nodes.
            
            If you are a validator your node might still connect to other validator nodes regardless of whether they are
            defined as reserved nodes.
        --rpc-external               
            Listen to all RPC interfaces.
            
            Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC proxy server to
            filter out dangerous methods. More details: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC. Use
            `--unsafe-rpc-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.
        --two                        
            Shortcut for `--name Two --validator` with session keys for `Two` added to keystore

        --unsafe-pruning             
            Force start with unsafe pruning settings.
            
            When running as a validator it is highly recommended to disable state pruning (i.e. 'archive') which is the
            default. The node will refuse to start as a validator if pruning is enabled unless this option is set.
        --unsafe-rpc-external        
            Listen to all RPC interfaces.
            
            Same as `--rpc-external`.
        --unsafe-ws-external         
            Listen to all Websocket interfaces.
            
            Same as `--ws-external` but doesn't warn you about it.
        --validator                  
            Enable validator mode.
            
            The node will be started with the authority role and actively participate in any consensus task that it can
            (e.g. depending on availability of local keys).
    -V, --version                    
            Prints version information

        --ws-external                
            Listen to all Websocket interfaces.
            
            Default is local. Note: not all RPC methods are safe to be exposed publicly. Use an RPC proxy server to
            filter out dangerous methods. More details: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/Public-RPC. Use
            `--unsafe-ws-external` to suppress the warning if you understand the risks.

            Should execute offchain workers on every block.
            
            By default it's only enabled for nodes that are authoring new blocks. [default: WhenValidating]  [possible
            values: Always, Never, WhenValidating]
        --execution <STRATEGY>
            The execution strategy that should be used by all execution contexts [possible values: Native, Wasm, Both,
            NativeElseWasm]

        --listen-addr <LISTEN_ADDR>...                           
            Listen on this multiaddress

    -l, --log <LOG_PATTERN>...
            Sets a custom logging filter. Syntax is <target>=<level>, e.g. -lsync=debug.
            
            Log levels (least to most verbose) are error, warn, info, debug, and trace. By default, all targets log
            `info`. The global log level can be set with -l<level>.
        --max-parallel-downloads <COUNT>
            Maximum number of peers from which to ask for the same blocks in parallel.
            
            This allows downloading announced blocks from multiple peers. Decrease to save traffic and risk increased
            latency. [default: 5]
        --max-runtime-instances <max-runtime-instances>          
            The size of the instances cache for each runtime.
            
            The default value is 8 and the values higher than 256 are ignored.
        --name <NAME>                                            
            The human-readable name for this node.
            
            The node name will be reported to the telemetry server, if enabled.
        --node-key <KEY>                                         
            The secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The value is a string that is parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
            
            `ed25519`: The value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32 byte secret key, i.e. 64 hex characters.
            
            The value of this option takes precedence over `--node-key-file`.
            
            WARNING: Secrets provided as command-line arguments are easily exposed. Use of this option should be limited
            to development and testing. To use an externally managed secret key, use `--node-key-file` instead.
        --node-key-file <FILE>
            The file from which to read the node's secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The contents of the file are parsed according to the choice of `--node-key-type` as follows:
            
            `ed25519`: The file must contain an unencoded 32 byte Ed25519 secret key.
            
            If the file does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
        --node-key-type <TYPE>
            The type of secret key to use for libp2p networking.
            
            The secret key of the node is obtained as follows:
            
            * If the `--node-key` option is given, the value is parsed as a secret key according to the type. See the
            documentation for `--node-key`.
            
            * If the `--node-key-file` option is given, the secret key is read from the specified file. See the
            documentation for `--node-key-file`.
            
            * Otherwise, the secret key is read from a file with a predetermined, type-specific name from the chain-
            specific network config directory inside the base directory specified by `--base-dir`. If this file
            does not exist, it is created with a newly generated secret key of the chosen type.
            
            The node's secret key determines the corresponding public key and hence the node's peer ID in the context of
            libp2p. [default: Ed25519]  [possible values: Ed25519]
        --out-peers <COUNT>
            Specify the number of outgoing connections we're trying to maintain [default: 25]

        --password <password>                                    
            Password used by the keystore

        --password-filename <PATH>                               
            File that contains the password used by the keystore

        --pool-kbytes <COUNT>
            Maximum number of kilobytes of all transactions stored in the pool [default: 20480]

        --pool-limit <COUNT>
            Maximum number of transactions in the transaction pool [default: 8192]

        --port <PORT>                                            
            Specify p2p protocol TCP port

        --prometheus-port <PORT>                                 
            Specify Prometheus data source server TCP Port

        --pruning <PRUNING_MODE>
            Specify the state pruning mode, a number of blocks to keep or 'archive'.
            
            Default is to keep all block states if the node is running as a validator (i.e. 'archive'), otherwise state
            is only kept for the last 256 blocks.
        --public-addr <PUBLIC_ADDR>...
            The public address that other nodes will use to connect to it. This can be used if there's a proxy in front
            of this node
        --reserved-nodes <ADDR>...                               
            Specify a list of reserved node addresses

        --rpc-cors <ORIGINS>
            Specify browser Origins allowed to access the HTTP & WS RPC servers.
            
            A comma-separated list of origins (protocol://domain or special `null` value). Value of `all` will disable
            origin validation. Default is to allow localhost and https://polkadot.js.org origins. When running in --dev
            mode the default is to allow all origins.
        --rpc-methods <METHOD SET>
            RPC methods to expose.
            
            - `Unsafe`: Exposes every RPC method.
            - `Safe`: Exposes only a safe subset of RPC methods, denying unsafe RPC methods.
            - `Auto`: Acts as `Safe` if RPC is served externally, e.g. when `--{rpc,ws}-external` is passed,
              otherwise acts as `Unsafe`. [default: Auto]  [possible values: Auto, Safe, Unsafe]
        --rpc-port <PORT>                                        
            Specify HTTP RPC server TCP port

        --sentry <sentry>...                                     
            Enable sentry mode.
            
            The node will be started with the authority role and participate in consensus tasks as an "observer", it
            will never actively participate regardless of whether it could (e.g. keys are available locally). This mode
            is useful as a secure proxy for validators (which would run detached from the network), since we want this
            node to participate in the full consensus protocols in order to have all needed consensus data available to
            relay to private nodes.
        --sentry-nodes <ADDR>...                                 
            Specify a list of sentry node public addresses.
            
            Can't be used with --public-addr as the sentry node would take precedence over the public address specified
            there.
        --state-cache-size <Bytes>                               
            Specify the state cache size [default: 67108864]

        --telemetry-url <URL VERBOSITY>...                       
            The URL of the telemetry server to connect to.
            
            This flag can be passed multiple times as a means to specify multiple telemetry endpoints. Verbosity levels
            range from 0-9, with 0 denoting the least verbosity. Expected format is 'URL VERBOSITY', e.g. `--telemetry-
            url 'wss://foo/bar 0'`.
        --tracing-receiver <RECEIVER>
            Receiver to process tracing messages [default: Log]  [possible values: Log, Telemetry]

        --tracing-targets <TARGETS>                              
            Comma separated list of targets for tracing

        --wasm-execution <METHOD>
            Method for executing Wasm runtime code [default: Interpreted]  [possible values: Interpreted, Compiled]

        --ws-max-connections <COUNT>                             
            Maximum number of WS RPC server connections

        --ws-port <PORT>
